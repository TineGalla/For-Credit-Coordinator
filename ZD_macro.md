# **Evaluation of Customer Service Email Responses Based on Quality Criteria**

Below is an assessment of each response against the **Customer Service Email Quality Criteria**.

---

## **Scenario 1: Request for Deadline Extension**  
**Request:** The student requests an extension due to illness, but an automatic 48-hour extension already applies.

### **Response 1 Evaluation:**

| **Criteria**                   | **Rating (1-5)** | **Comments** |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**                    | 5               | The response clearly explains the policy and informs the student about the automatic extension. |
| **Tone**                       | 4               | Professional and neutral, but could include more empathy acknowledging the student's illness. |
| **Grammar and Spelling**        | 5               | No grammatical errors; well-structured. |
| **Relevance**                   | 5               | Directly addresses the student's concern and provides essential details. |
| **Actionability**               | 4               | Provides information on the automatic extension but could explicitly confirm that no action is needed from the student. |
| **Personalization**             | 3               | The response lacks a personal touch and does not address the student by name. |
| **Response Time & Acknowledgment** | 5          | Acknowledges receipt of the request appropriately. |
| **Compliance & Policy Adherence** | 5           | The response accurately explains the extension policy. |
| **Formatting & Readability**     | 5               | Well-structured, with clear sentences and logical flow. |
| **Positive Closing**             | 3               | Ends the email appropriately but could include a warmer closing. |

### **Constructive Feedback:**
âœ” **Improve empathy** by acknowledging the student's illness more personally.  
âœ” **Clarify next steps**â€”explicitly state that no further action is required.  
âœ” **Increase personalization** by addressing the student by name.  

### **Suggested Revision (More Empathetic & Clearer):**
> "Hi [Student's Name],  
> I'm sorry to hear that you're unwell, and I hope you feel better soon. Please note that each student automatically receives a 48-hour extension beyond the original deadline, so no further action is required on your part. However, please ensure you submit your assignment within this window to avoid any penalties. Let us know if you need further clarification. Wishing you a speedy recovery!"

## **Scenario 2: Withdrawal Appeal**  
**Request:** The student claims wrongful withdrawal due to a learning disability and alleges discrimination.

### **Response 2 Evaluation:**

| **Criteria**                   | **Rating (1-5)** | **Comments** |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**                    | 4               | The response is structured well, but the reasoning for withdrawal could be made clearer. |
| **Tone**                       | 3               | The response is professional but lacks empathy, given the sensitivity of the issue. |
| **Grammar and Spelling**        | 5               | Well-written and grammatically sound. |
| **Relevance**                   | 5               | Addresses the withdrawal issue and explains attendance policies. |
| **Actionability**               | 4               | Provides a one-time attendance exception but could further clarify next steps if the student has concerns. |
| **Personalization**             | 3               | Uses a neutral tone but does not directly acknowledge the studentâ€™s individual struggles. |
| **Response Time & Acknowledgment** | 5          | Acknowledges receipt of the concern appropriately. |
| **Compliance & Policy Adherence** | 5           | The response aligns with policy and provides an exception where possible. |
| **Formatting & Readability**     | 5               | Structured with a logical flow. |
| **Positive Closing**             | 3               | Could include a more supportive and encouraging closing. |

### **Constructive Feedback:**
âœ” **Increase empathy**â€”acknowledge the student's frustration and concerns more directly.  
âœ” **Clarify next steps**â€”offer guidance on how the student can appeal or get additional support.  
âœ” **Strengthen the closing**â€”provide reassurance or encouragement.  

### **Suggested Revision (More Supportive & Clearer Guidance):**
> "Hi [Student's Name],  
> Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns. We understand that this situation may be frustrating, and we sincerely appreciate your efforts in the course. While we must adhere to the attendance policies to ensure fairness, we recognize that unforeseen circumstances can arise.

## **Scenario 3: Request for Excused Absence**

|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**                    | 5               | The response is clear and outlines the policy on excused absences. |
| **Tone**                       | 4               | Professional but could acknowledge the student's commitment more. |

| **Relevance**                   | 5               | Directly addresses the request and explains the policy. |
| **Actionability**               | 3               | Explains the decision but doesn't offer any potential alternatives for the student. |
| **Personalization**             | 3               | The response is neutral but could acknowledge the studentâ€™s proactive approach. |
| **Response Time & Acknowledgment** | 5          | The response is timely and acknowledges the request. |
| **Compliance & Policy Adherence** | 5           | The response correctly follows attendance policy guidelines. |

| **Positive Closing**             | 3               | Ends the email appropriately but could be more encouraging. |

### **Constructive Feedback:**
âœ” **Acknowledge studentâ€™s proactive approach**â€”thank them for notifying ahead of time.  
âœ” **Provide alternatives**â€”mention any potential resources or future flexibility.  

### **Suggested Revision (More Supportive & Helpful):**
> "Hi [Student's Name],  
> Thank you for reaching out and for proactively informing us about your scheduling conflict. While we completely understand that academic commitments like midterms can be challenging, our attendance policy only allows additional excused absences under extraordinary circumstances such as hospitalization or a family emergency. Unfortunately, we are unable to grant an exception in this case.  
> However, if you anticipate further conflicts, we recommend discussing scheduling strategies with your instructor or program coordinator. Please let us know if thereâ€™s anything else we can assist you with.  
> Wishing you the best with your studies!"

## **Overall Takeaways**
- **Response 1 (Deadline Extension)** is strong but could **improve empathy**, **clarify next steps**, and **increase personalization**.
- **Response 2 (Withdrawal Appeal)** provides clear policy details but lacks **empathetic language**, **guidance on appeal options**, and **a warm closing**.
- **Response 3 (Excused Absence Request)** effectively communicates policy but should **acknowledge the student's effort** and suggest **alternative solutions**.

By making these **small adjustments**, the responses can be more **empathetic, actionable, and customer-friendly** while maintaining **professionalism and policy adherence**. ðŸš€

### **Scenario A: Request for an Excused Absence Due to Injury**  

```md 

Hi [Student's Name],  

Thank you for reaching out and letting us know about your situation. We’re sorry to hear about your injury, and we hope you’re recovering well.  

Per our attendance policy, *injuries requiring medical attention qualify for an excused absence upon proof verification*. Since this is your second absence, this will not count toward your *two allowed unexcused absences*.  

Please send any relevant documentation (such as a medical certificate or a doctor's note), and we will update your attendance record accordingly.  

If you need any assistance catching up on missed coursework, feel free to explore our course materials on **[course portal link]** or let us know if you have any concerns.  

Wishing you a smooth recovery!  

Regards, 
Tine
